# Maintainers Guide

This document describes tools, tasks and workflow that one needs to be familiar
with in order to effectively maintain this project. If you use this package
within your own software as is but don't plan on modifying it, this guide is
**not** for you.

## Tasks

### Testing

Run unit tests locally using the `npm test` command. Tests are also run
automatically on all branches using
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/vscode-hack).

### Releasing

This extension is published at
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranayagarwal.vscode-hack.

To push a new release, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the `master` branch is up to date with all changes and has been
   tested.
2. Merge a new commit with the following changes:
   - Update the version in `package.json` by following the versioning guide
     below
   - Re-run `npm install` to update package-lock file version and regenerate
     `NOTICE.md`
   - Add a description of all changes since the last release in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Add or update the "Latest releases" section in `README.md` with release
     highlights
3. Draft a new GitHub release:
   - Releases should always target the `master` branch
   - Tag version and release title should both be in the format "v1.2.3", with
     the version matching the value in `package.json`
   - Copy your new section from `CHANGELOG.md` in the release description
4. Once the release is published, a new Github build will automatically start.
   Ensure that the build passes and a new `vscode-hack-[version].vsix` is added
   as an asset to the GitHub release page.
5. Publish the new version to the VS Code Marketplace. This can only be done
   from Pranay Agarwal's Microsoft account.

## Workflow

### Versioning and Tags

Even though this project is not published as an npm package, it uses a rough
form of semver for versioning. Increment the MAJOR or MINOR version for feature
additions, depending on size and impact, and PATCH version for bug fixes.

Releases are tagged in git and published on the repository releases page on
GitHub.

### Branches

All development should happen in feature branches. `master` should be ready for
quick patching and publishing at all times.

### Issue Management

Labels are used to run issues through an organized workflow. Here are the basic
definitions:

- `bug`: A confirmed bug report. A bug is considered confirmed when reproduction
  steps have been documented and the issue has been reproduced.
- `enhancement` or `feature request`: A feature request for something this
  package might not already do.
- `docs`: An issue that is purely about documentation work.
- `tests`: An issue that is purely about testing work.
- `needs feedback`: An issue that may have claimed to be a bug but was not
  reproducible, or was otherwise missing some information.
- `discussion`: An issue that is purely meant to hold a discussion. Typically
  the maintainers are looking for feedback in this issues.
- `question`: An issue that is like a support request because the user's usage
  was not correct.
- `semver:major|minor|patch`: Metadata about how resolving this issue would
  affect the version number.
- `security`: An issue that has special consideration for security reasons.
- `good first contribution`: An issue that has a well-defined relatively-small
  scope, with clear expectations. It helps when the testing approach is also
  known.
- `duplicate`: An issue that is functionally the same as another issue. Apply
  this only if you've linked the other issue by number.
- `external`: An issue that is caused by an external dependency and cannot be
  fixed here.

**Triage** is the process of taking new issues that aren't yet "seen" and
marking them with a basic level of information with labels. An issue should have
**one** of the following labels applied: `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`,
`needs feedback`, `docs`, `tests`, or `discussion`.

Issues are closed when a resolution has been reached. If for any reason a closed
issue seems relevant once again, reopening is great and better than creating a
duplicate issue.

## Everything else

When in doubt, find the other maintainers and ask.
